            <h2>Why Should Internet Accessibility be Considered a Human Right?</h2>
            <p>Nowadays, the internet is used not only as an entertainment mechanism but also as a way to enhance the rights we enjoy in our day-to-day lives. Here are some of the reasons internet accessibility should be treated as a human right given the modern world we live in.</p>
            <ul>
                <img src="1.jpeg" width="630px" class="right-align">
                <li>Freedom of Speech</li>
                <p>The internet allows people to share their thoughts and opinions, promoting healthy discussions. Not having access to the internet significantly limits a person's reach, isolating them from the vast exchange of ideas and perspectives that occur online. In today's interconnected world, the internet serves as a global forum where individuals can engage in dialogue with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures. Without internet access, individuals are excluded from participating in these discussions and may struggle to have their voices heard on important issues. This digital divide exacerbates existing inequalities and hinders social cohesion by excluding marginalized communities from the benefits of online connectivity.</p>
                <li>Access to Information</li>
                <p>Especially in countries with restricted access to information due to government control, the internet allows people to circumvent these restrictions and access information that would be otherwise impossible to reach. For example, the <a href="https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en" target="_blank">Uncensored Minecraft Library</a> is a collection of content that has been censored or prohibited in some countries. Moreover, these efforts demonstrate the resilience of the internet as a decentralized network that thrives on the principles of openness and decentralization. However, it's important to acknowledge that accessing censored content can come with risks, as governments may employ surveillance, censorship, or other punitive measures to suppress dissenting voices. Despite these challenges, the internet continues to serve as a beacon of hope for those seeking to challenge authoritarianism and advocate for greater transparency, accountability, and freedom of expression.</p>
                <li>Necessity in Day-to-Day Life</li>
                <p>It is hard to imagine a world without internet access due to the crucial role it plays in society. Especially in developing countries, the internet plays an important role in allowing communities to have access to basic needs, such as food, water, transportation, health, and education.  It serves as a catalyst for innovation and empowerment, enabling communities to find creative solutions to longstanding challenges. For instance, online marketplaces connect farmers directly with consumers, eliminating middlemen and increasing their income. Mobile payment systems facilitate financial transactions, empowering individuals with limited access to traditional banking services. Moreover, the internet facilitates the dissemination of vital information about health and sanitation practices, empowering communities to make informed decisions and adopt preventive measures against diseases.</p>

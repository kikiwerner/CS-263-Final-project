            <h2>Why Should Internet Accessibility be Considered a Human Right?</h2>
            <p>Nowadays, the internet is used not only as an entertainment mechanism but also as a way to enhance the rights we enjoy in our day-to-day lives. Here are some of the reasons internet accessibility should be treated as a human right given the modern world we live in.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Freedom of Speech</li>
                <p>The internet allows people to share their thoughts and opinions, promoting healthy discussions.</p>
                <li>Access to Information</li>
                <p>Especially in countries with restricted access to information due to government control, the internet allows people to circumvent these restrictions and access information that would be otherwise impossible to reach. For example, the <a href="https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en" target="_blank">Uncensored Minecraft Library</a> is a collection of content that has been censored or prohibited in some countries.</p>
                <li>Necessity in Day-to-Day Life</li>
                <p>It is hard to imagine a world without internet access due to the crucial role it plays in society. Especially in developing countries, the internet plays an important role in allowing communities to have access to basic needs, such as food, water, transportation, health, and education.</p>
